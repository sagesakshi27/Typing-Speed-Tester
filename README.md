# ⌨️ Typing Speed Tester

A clean and interactive **Typing Speed Test Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

This project focuses on **real-time typing analysis**, **WPM calculation**, **accuracy tracking**, and dynamic UI feedback to simulate a basic typing test environment.

> It is developed as a frontend practice project to strengthen DOM manipulation skills, event handling logic, and UI state management using pure JavaScript.

## 📌 Purpose of This Project

This project is built to:

- Practice DOM manipulation
- Implement real-time calculations
- Understand event-driven programming
- Strengthen JavaScript logic building

> ⚠️ This is a frontend-only project. No backend or database is used.

---

## 🧠 How WPM & Accuracy Are Calculated

### Words Per Minute (WPM)

WPM is calculated using:

```bash
(number of valid words typed / time elapsed in seconds) × 60
```

Only non-empty words are counted.

### Accuracy

Accuracy is calculated using:

```bash
(correct characters / total characters typed) × 100
```

Incorrect and extra characters reduce accuracy.
